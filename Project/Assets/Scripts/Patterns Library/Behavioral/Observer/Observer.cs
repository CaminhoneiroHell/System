//1 Differentiate between the core(or independent) functionality and the optional(or dependent) functionality.The former will act as a publisher, and the later will serve as subscribers.

//2 Create the Subscriber interface. In most cases, a single update method is enough.

//3 Create the Publisher interface and describe the operations for starting and terminating subscription in it.Remember that publisher should work with subscribers via their common interface.

//4 You have to decide where you put the actual subscription list and the implementation of the subscribtion methods.
//Usually, this code looks the same for all types of publishers. So the obvious place to put it is a base abstract class derived directly from a Publisher interface.
//But if you are integrating Observer to an existing class hierarchy, it might be more convenient to create a small helper class that will be maintaining the subscription for specific publishers.

//4 Create Concrete Publisher classes.They should send notifications to the whole list of subscribers each time when something important happens inside the object.

//5 Implement update methods in Concrete Subscribers. Most subscribers would need some context data about the event.
//It can be passed as an argument to the update method. But there is another option.
//Upon receiving a notification, the subscriber can fetch any data directly from the publisher object.
//In this case, the publisher must pass itself via the update method.The less flexible option is to link a publisher to the subscriber permanently via the constructor.

//6 The Client code must create all necessary subscribers and register them with proper publishers
